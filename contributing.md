# Contributing to EviAtlas

The goal of this guide is to help you get up and contributing to EviAtlas as 
quickly as possible.

Please note that citationchaser is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.


### Fixing typos
Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using
the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the _source_ file.

*  DO: edit a roxygen comment in a `.R` file below `R/`.
*  DO NOT: edit an `.Rd` file below `man/`.

Similarly, typos/errors in the supporting documents (e.g. these contributing guidelines, code-of-conduct.md)
may be edited directly using the GitHub web interface.

The exception to the above is when typos/errors occur in the README.md document. To correct these:

  * Fork the respository to your personal GitHub account
  * Edit the README.Rmd document to fix the error
  * Knit the README.Rmd document to produce the corrected README.md
  * Commit changes and push both corrected documents to your forked respository
  * Issue a pull request (see the section on [Pull Requests](#pull-requests), below).
  

### Filing an issue

When filing an issue, the most important thing is to include a minimal 
reproducible example so that we can quickly verify the problem, and then figure 
out how to fix it. See "[Writing a good reproducible example](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/reprex-dos-and-donts.html)".


1.  **Packages** should be loaded at the top of the script, so it's easy to
    see which ones the example needs.
  
1.  Spend a little bit of time ensuring that your **code** is easy for others to
    read:
  
    * make sure you've used spaces and your variable names are concise, but
      informative
  
    * use comments generously to indicate where your problem lies
  
    * do your best to remove everything that is not related to the problem.  

You can check you have actually made a reproducible example by starting up a 
fresh R session and pasting your script in.


### Pull Requests

#### Getting Started
* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* Familiarise yourself with Git and Github, using the [resources](#additional-resources) at the end of this page.

#### Prerequisites
Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and
make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s a problem. If you’ve found a
bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal 
[reproducible example](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/reprex-dos-and-donts.html).

#### Pull request process
*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).  
*  Look at the Travis and AppVeyor build status before and after making changes.
The `README` should contain badges for any continuous integration services used
by the package.  
*  New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org).
You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to
apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with 
your PR.  
*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with
[Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/markdown.html), 
for documentation.  
*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat). Contributions
with test cases included are easier to accept.
