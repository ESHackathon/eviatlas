<span class="c12"><h3>About EviAtlas</h3></span><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">EviAtlas is an Open Source tool for creating and hosting visualisations from databases of studies created within systematic maps and systematic reviews. The tool was created as part of the ongoing Evidence Synthesis Hackathon series of events (</span><span class="c4"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.evidencesynthesishackathon.com&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1553166383780000">www.evidencesynthesishackathon.com</a></span><span class="c0">) aimed at producing free-to-use tools to support systematic reviews and maps across disciplines.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">EviAtlas allows users to create a suite of visualisations from a database of studies, including Evidence Atlases (interactive geographical maps showing studies and their details over space), Heat Maps (cross tabulations of categorical variables that highlight clusters and gaps in the evidence), descriptive plots that help to visualise the evidence base (e.g. the number of publications per year), and human-readable databases that are easily filterable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">EviAtlas is built on coding written in R (</span><span class="c4"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.r-project.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1553166383781000">https://www.r-project.org</a></span><span class="c0">) and uses a Shiny App to provide a web-based user interface. As we develop the app further, we will provide source code to allow R users to further refine their visualisations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">EviAtlas is currently in a testing phase but is fully functional. We intend to add further options and functionality in the near future.
