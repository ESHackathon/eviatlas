<h3>How EviAtlas Works</h3>

<p class="c1"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Upload a systematic review dataset (csv format) using the panel on the right, and then use the left sidebar to view a systematic map generated from your dataset, as well as some common plots used in systematic reviews.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Please ensure that your database is formatted in the correct way - column labels should all appear in the first row. To create an Evidence Atlas you will need one column with latitude data and one with longitude data; you can select these spatial variables in the Evidence Atlas pane. Please provide the lat/long in decimal degrees. </span><span class="c6">In the future we hope to provide tools to recognise multiple coordinate types</span><span class="c6">. If you have categorical variables that you wish to cross-tabulate in a Heat Map or other visualisation, EviAtlas currently requires that you store these categories in a single column. </span><span class="c6">In the future we hope to integrate </span><span class="c6 c11">tidy </span><span class="c6">principles that will allow you to aggregate and disaggregate complex data automatically.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Please use the example dataset to see what EviAtlas can do!</span></p>
