<h3>Systematic Maps and Systematic Reviews</h3>
<p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c6">Systematic maps and reviews are rigorous, comprehensive, transparent and repeatable methods for reviewing research literature on a particular topic. Systematic maps are overviews of nature of an evidence base relevant to a broad (open) question of policy or management relevance. Systematic reviews are detailed analyses of the findings of a group of similar studies, for example examining the effectiveness of an intervention or the impact of a factor. More information about systematic reviews and maps can be found for the following disciplines: </span><span class="c4"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.environmentalevidence.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1553166383782000">environment</a></span><span class="c6">, </span><span class="c4"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://campbellcollaboration.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1553166383783000">social welfare and international development</a></span><span class="c6">, </span><span class="c4"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cochrane.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1553166383783000">healthcare</a></span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">During the process of conducting a systematic map or systematic review, researchers typically produce a detailed database of relevant studies that includes various columns of descriptive information. Some of this data may be rich, textual descriptions (meta-data), and some of it may be categorical or numerical data (coding or quantitative data). Coding (for example different levels of a factor; high, medium, low, or different country names) allows a database to be easily filtered and searched, and allows the production of interactive visualisations of the evidence base to examine what research has been conducted, when, where, how, by whom, etc.. EviAtlas is the first Open Source tool that allows users to produce a range of different visualisations for their systematic reviews and maps. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
