# EviAtlas

EviAtlas is a shiny app for visualising the datasets produced by systematic maps. You can access the app at: https://estech.shinyapps.io/eviatlas/

This repository is DEPRECATED, and current tool development is occuring within the R metaverse: https://github.com/rmetaverse/eviatlas

EviAtlas was produced as part of the first Evidence Synthesis Hackathon, hosted by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) and organized by researchers at SEI and the Australian National University. 

A paper describing the collaborative process used to develop EviAtlas is published in the journal Environmental Evidence, and can be accessed here:
